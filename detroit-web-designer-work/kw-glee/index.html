<p>KW Glee is Canada's top youth pop choir based out of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Prior to KW Glee's website creation, they had no web-presence other than a Facebook page, leaving the ability to offer audition and ticket purchasing options to Facebook and their ever-changing "wall."</p>

<p>Instead of being content with relying on a third party, KW Glee decided to take advantage of the Internet and commissioned their very own web presence to be built focusing on auditions, scheduling, and ticket information amongst other pertinent information.</p>

<p>I decided on Wordpress due to budget limitations and the need to update the website with frequent news postings. KW Glee takes full advantage of their CMS and updates regularly, keeping their readers engaged. Their website is a hit and so is every performance in which they give!</p>
