<p>The website for Party Bus Detroit was a bit on the old side and I was tasked with creating their new website.</p> 

<p>I worked closely with the owner of Party Bus Detroit in order to come up with a responsive website that not only functioned well but expressed the pertinent information needed for anyone to come onto the site and receive a quote, contact the company, or simply do some window shopping. Some things worth noting are the custom quote request feature as well as the ability to sort vehicles by color, size, and vehicle type. This was all coded without the use of a CMS or framework in order to give the website extensive flexibility in the future.</p>

<p>This project went great and I look forward to working with them in the future to create even more great branding and features that will make their website even more interactive.</p>
