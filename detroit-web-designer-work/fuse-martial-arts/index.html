meta: Fuse Martial Arts needed a website that they could use as a way to promote their growing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu / Muay Thai school in Clinton Township, Michigan. I asked the about the most important information to convey and rolled with that. Gaining approval on everything almost immediately I began coding the site.

<p>Fuse Martial Arts needed a website that they could use as a way to promote their growing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu / Muay Thai school in Clinton Township, Michigan.</p> 

<p>I was asked for a simple site that could be used to give visitors information about class options, schedules, instructor information, and more. I decided to use Wordpress as the back end because I wanted to give the owner an easy option for updating or changing information on the site after it was complete.</p>

<p>All in all the project went off without a hitch and they've been using the website as a recruitment tool ever since</p>
