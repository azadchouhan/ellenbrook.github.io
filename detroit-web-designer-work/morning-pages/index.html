<p>Morning Pages is a website based on the self-help teachings of Julie Cameron. She stresses that writing three pages per day will give you insight into your thoughts and allow you focus on what really matters. </p>

<p>I decided to make this site in order to give people an outlet to write their morning pages from anywhere; at any time. The site is pretty straight forward with the default user options being the most private. However, users have the option of creating public profiles in order to show off their badges, stats, and more. </p>

<p>Morning Pages has a growing community of great people and I'm glad to be part of it.</p>
