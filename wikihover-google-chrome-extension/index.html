<p>Wikihover is a Google Chrome extension that completely removes the most annoying aspect of browsing Wikipedia; getting lost in a sea of tabs. That's right, this Chrome extension immediately makes browsing Wikipedia exponentially more enjoyable for just about anybody who installs it.</p>

<p>WikiHover is open source and everything is freely available on the <a href="https://github.com/ellenbrook/Wikihover" rel="nofollow">Wikihover Github repo</a>. WikiHover is available in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikihover/aohcgnijnfgcofeijeeoinefklfghdcc" rel="nofollow">Chrome web store</a> for free. All that I ask if that if you like it, rate it and share it!</p>
