link-title: 24 Grille
website: http://24grille.com
meta: Located inside of the Westin Book Cadillac in Detroit, 24 Grille offers patrons a great meal at an affordable price. Their atmosphere is second to none and at the time, their website did not reflect that. I came up with the concept of design and presented it to the owner. A simple, yet effective, single page website that contained all of the pertinent informaiton regarding the restaurant. Food and drink menus, reservation options, information regarding their private dining area, and a simple and easy way for customers to contact management regarding private events and parties.
