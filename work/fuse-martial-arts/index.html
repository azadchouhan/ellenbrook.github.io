meta: Fuse Martial Arts needed a website that they could use as a way to promote their growing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu / Muay Thai school in Clinton Township, Michigan. I was asked for a simple site that could be used to give visitors information about class options, schedules, instructor information, and more. I decided to use Wordpress as the back end because I wanted to give the owner an easy option for updating or changing information on the site after it was complete.
