meta: Placed in charge of designing and creating a Wordpress-backed website for Fuse Martial Arts in clinton Township, Michigan. Fuse Martial Arts wanted to avoid "MMA" and focus more on the more child-friendly area of martial arts in general. Some key items used include Wordpress custom fields to represent bar graphs on each martial art's website and the use of custom "Post" distribution on the coaches and classes pages.
