website: http://morningpages.net/
meta: A close friend of mine told me how much he benefited from writing every day so I gave it a shot and I loved it. Through writing every day I discovered that I'd like to to use my passion of code to create a website that others can benefit from. Thus Morning Pages was born. I'd love it if you checked it out.
