<p>Hi. I'm Eric Ellenbrook and, as the title says, I create websites for people like you. Especially if you're a studio in or around the Detroit area that is looking for a new addition to their team.</p>

<h3>My non-developer life</h3>
<p>When I'm away from the computer, the thing that I enjoy the most is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am a blue belt and I've been training for over two years. In that time I've dropped 40 pounds, gained a lot of confidence, and learned the hard work that it takes to succeed.</p>
