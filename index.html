<p>Hi. I'm Eric Ellenbrook and as the header says, I create websites for people like you. Especially if you're a studio in or around the Detroit area that is looking for a new addition to their team.</p>

<h3>What I care about the most</h3>
<p>I like accessibility, clean design, symmetry, learning as much as I can, and more. I'm currently working on a few projects which you'll be able to check out on my <a href="http://github.com" title="Eric Ellenbrook on GitHub">GitHub page</a>. Since I try and learn/incorporate something new with each project, you'll most likely see a lot of commits that correct previous mistakes I made or simply refactoring to what I've already done because I discovered a new and more efficient way of carrying out the task.</p>

<h3>"Tell us about your non-developer life!"</h3>
<p>Fine! For those of you who stuck it out, I suppose I can give you what you're looking for. I enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in my free time. I am a blue belt and I've been training for over two years. In that time I've dropped 40 pounds, gained a lot of confidence, and learned the hard work that it takes to succeed.</p>

<p>Finally, if you'd like to get in touch with me, just take a look at the side bar or the footer and you'll find all of the ways of contacting me. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
