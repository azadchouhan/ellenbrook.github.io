<p>Hi. I'm Eric Ellenbrook and, as the title says, I create websites for people like you. Especially if you're a studio in or around the Detroit area that is looking for a new addition to their team.</p>

<h3 class="list-header">Things I like</h3>
<div class="container">
	<dl class="half">
		<dt>Trello</dt>
		<dd>An organization tool&mdash;No, the organization tool that keeps me on task for whatever project I'm working on. If you don't use it, you should.</dd>

		<dt>Dropbox</dt>
		<dd>My work is anywhere I want it to be with Dropbox. It's the best. <a href="https://db.tt/7DL9FkIl">Shameless Dropbox referral link</a>.</dd>

		<dt>Codekit</dt>
		<dd>I like Codekit because it compiles, minifies, and does a whole lot of other things for a variety of languages. <a href="http://ellenbrook.github.io/2014/09/01/code-kit-you-need-it-trust-me.html">I wrote a blog post about it</a>.</dd>
	</dl>

	<dl class="half">
		<dt>Sass</dt>
		<dd>Once you go Sass you never go...back? The point is that there's no other way to write CSS. If you're not writing Sass you're crazy. Write Sass.</dd>

		<dt>Loremify</dt>
		<dd>A fast and easy way to toss some dummy text into your pages. No need to open a new tab anymore, folks! I like Loremify.</dd>

		<dt>ShopTalk</dt>
		<dd>I'm a podcast fiend. ShopTalk is a podcast featuring Chris Coyer and Dave Rupert. They know things and I learn from them.</dd>

<h3>My non-developer life</h3>
<p>When I'm away from the computer, the thing that I enjoy the most is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am a blue belt and I've been training for over two years. In that time I've dropped 40 pounds, gained a lot of confidence, and learned the hard work that it takes to succeed.</p>

<p>Finally, if you'd like to get in touch with me, just take a look at the side bar or the footer and you'll find all of the ways of contacting me. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
